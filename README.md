# I'm Using GitHub Under Protest

Some of my projects currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I host newer projects [elsewhere](https://git.kompot.si/g1smo/). We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects. You can also listen to [a radio show I made about it](https://radiostudent.si/druzba/tehno-klistir/mali-mehki-kplgit).

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](https://git.kompot.si/g1smo/) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly (or contact me on mastodon, @g1smo@toot.si).

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without my permission. I do not consent to GitHub's use of my projects'
code in Copilot.
